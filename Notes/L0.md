L0: Intro to ML and Fastai
What is ML:
## Usage of DL

- Natural language processing (NLP):: Answering questions; speech recognition; summarizing documents; classifying documents; finding names, dates, etc. in documents; searching for articles mentioning a concept
- Computer vision:: Satellite and drone imagery interpretation (e.g., for disaster resilience); face recognition; image captioning; reading traffic signs; locating pedestrians and vehicles in autonomous vehicles
- Medicine:: Finding anomalies in radiology images, including CT, MRI, and X-ray images; counting features in pathology slides; measuring features in ultrasounds; diagnosing diabetic retinopathy
- Biology:: Folding proteins; classifying proteins; many genomics tasks, such as tumor-normal sequencing and classifying clinically actionable genetic mutations; cell classification; analyzing protein/protein interactions
- Image generation:: Colorizing images; increasing image resolution; removing noise from images; converting images to art in the style of famous artists
- Recommendation systems:: Web search; product recommendations; home page layout
- Playing games:: Chess, Go, most Atari video games, and many real-time strategy games
- Robotics:: Handling objects that are challenging to locate (e.g., transparent, shiny, lacking texture) or hard to pick up
- Other applications:: Financial and logistical forecasting, text to speech, and much more...

## How to learn DL

What you will need to do to succeed however is to apply what you learn in this book to a personal project, and always persevere.
-> Practice directly

The way we will be taught:

- Teaching the *whole game*. We'll start by showing how to use a complete, working, very usable, state-of-the-art deep learning network to solve real-world problems, using simple, expressive tools. And then we'll gradually dig deeper and deeper into understanding how those tools are made, and how the tools that make those tools are made, and so on…
- Always teaching through examples. We'll ensure that there is a context and a purpose that you can understand intuitively, rather than starting with algebraic symbol manipulation.
- Simplifying as much as possible. We've spent years building tools and teaching methods that make previously complex topics very simple.
- Removing barriers. Deep learning has, until now, been a very exclusive game. We're breaking it open, and ensuring that everyone can play.

## What is ML

*Machine learning* is, like regular programming, a way to get computers to complete a specific task.

Weights are just variables, and a weight assignment is a particular choice of values for those variables. The program's inputs are values that it processes in order to produce its results—for instance, taking image pixels as inputs, and returning the classification "dog" as a result. The program's weight assignments are other values that define how the program will operate.

We've changed the name of our box from *program* to *model*. This is to follow modern terminology and to reflect that the *model* is a special kind of program: it's one that can do *many different things*, depending on the *weights*.

Notice the distinction between the model's *results*  (e.g., the moves in a checkers game) and its *performance* (e.g., whether it wins the game, or how quickly it wins). 

Also note that once the model is trained—that is, once we've chosen our final, best, favorite weight assignment—then we can think of the weights as being *part of the model*, since we're not varying them any more.

Therefore, actually *using* a model after it's trained looks like
